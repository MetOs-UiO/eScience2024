Basic Rules for the course
==========================



  #. Write your scripts/notebooks into the clone of your eScience2024-projects fork.
  #. Work in your ``Group#`` subfolder in the clone (or even a subsubfolder for your work, one level deeper) to reduce number of potential conflicts when merging.
  #. If there are files that are automatically created in that folder that should not be tracked, update `.gitignore`
  #. Do not store data in that folder unless it is \< 10 Mb. See :doc:`Sharing Data <./data>`.
  #. Do not download large number of files/large datasets into your home directory. 
  #. Do not try to make files in the read-only folders (you will get errors on save). Mind where your File browser is when making new notebook/starting new Launcher.
  #. Make issues in this repo, See :doc:`Contribute to this page <../contrib>`.
