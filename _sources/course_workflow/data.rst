Sharing data
============

Small size data (\<10 Mb) can be shared directly through the `eScience2024-projects repo <https://github.com/MetOs-UiO/eScience2024-projects>`_.

Larger data will be put into read-only ``~/shared-craas1-nn9989k-geo4992/data/`` by request (ask @mvdebolsiy to copy it there).

If you want to share something real quick with members of your group: you can access other user's home directories at ``~/shared-craas1-ns9989k-geo4992/dataporten-home/fc-3auid-3a<feide-user-id>/``.
These folders are read-only for everyone except the owner.
